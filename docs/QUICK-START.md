## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If port 5173 is busy:

```bash
# The dev server will automatically try port 5174, 5175, etc.
# Or specify a port:
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Application Won't Start

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Try again
npm run dev
```

### Dashboard Not Showing in Sidebar

- Make sure you're logged in
- Dashboard visible to all users (no admin requirement)
- Refresh the page if needed
