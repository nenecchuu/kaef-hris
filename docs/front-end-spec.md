# KAEF HRIS Employee Master Data UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for KAEF HRIS Employee Master Data's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience for HRD managers overseeing employee data across PT Kimia Farma's extensive pharmaceutical enterprise.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

- **HRD Manager (Primary):** Strategic HR leaders who need comprehensive oversight across all divisions and subsidiaries. They require executive dashboards, cross-divisional analytics, and organizational management tools. High data literacy, efficiency-focused, need confirmations for critical changes.

- **Division Manager:** Department heads managing employees within specific pharmaceutical business units (Manufacturing, Distribution, Retail, International). Need focused views of their division with limited cross-divisional access. Require quick employee lookup and basic management functions.

- **HR Staff:** Day-to-day HR operations personnel handling employee data entry, profile updates, and routine HR tasks. Need efficient forms, clear validation, and streamlined workflows for bulk operations.

- **Employee (Self-Service):** Employees accessing their own profile data and career information. Limited permissions, mobile-friendly access, focus on personal data review and career path visualization.

#### Usability Goals

- **Efficiency for Power Users:** HRD managers can complete frequent tasks (employee searches, status updates, reports) within 30 seconds with minimal clicks
- **Clarity for Complex Data:** Large datasets (10,000+ employees) presented clearly with effective filtering, sorting, and progressive disclosure
- **Error Prevention:** Confirmation workflows for critical changes (salary, termination, transfers) prevent costly mistakes
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Field managers at factories and retail locations can access essential employee information on tablets/phones
- **Pharmaceutical Context:** Industry-specific workflows (certification tracking, regulatory compliance) feel natural and integrated

#### Design Principles

1. **Data Density with Clarity** - Present comprehensive employee information efficiently while maintaining readability and preventing cognitive overload
2. **Hierarchy-Aware Design** - Interface adapts based on user role and organizational position, showing relevant data and actions
3. **Search-First Philosophy** - Prominent, powerful search capabilities as the primary navigation method for large employee datasets
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential information immediately, provide easy access to detailed data when needed
5. **Confirmation-Conscious** - Critical actions require clear confirmation with impact preview, especially for organizational changes
