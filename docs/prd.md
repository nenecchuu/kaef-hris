# KAEF HRIS Employee Master Data Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Establish a comprehensive Employee Master Data system separate from the User authentication system
- Implement career path tracking and progression for employee development within PT Kimia Farma's pharmaceutical industry context
- Create proper employee data structures with complete professional information aligned with Indonesian employment practices
- Organize employees by PT Kimia Farma's actual organizational divisions and subsidiary structure
- Enable HRD managers to have complete oversight and management of all employee data across all divisions and subsidiaries
- Provide centralized employee information management for HR operations across 10 factories, 1,234 pharmacies, and 419 health clinics
- Support employee lifecycle management from onboarding to career progression within the pharmaceutical industry

### Background Context

The current KAEF HRIS system uses a User model primarily focused on authentication and basic organizational structure. However, for a comprehensive HRIS solution for PT Kimia Farma Tbk - Indonesia's largest pharmaceutical BUMN, we need a dedicated Employee Master Data system that separates concerns between system users and employee records. This separation allows for better data integrity, more detailed employee information tracking, and supports complex HR operations like career path management, detailed organizational hierarchies, and comprehensive employee oversight.

The system needs to reflect PT Kimia Farma's actual organizational structure including its Board of Directors, business unit divisions (Manufacturing, Distribution, Retail Healthcare, International), and subsidiary companies (PT Kimia Farma Apotek, PT Kimia Farma Trading & Distribution, PT Kimia Farma Sungwun Pharmacopia, PT Sinkona Indonesia Lestari, PT Phapros Tbk, and Kimia Farma Dawaa). This foundation will support future HR modules like payroll, performance management, and leave management while enabling HRD managers to effectively oversee employee data across the entire pharmaceutical enterprise.
