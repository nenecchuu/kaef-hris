## Technical Implementation Details

### Clean Code Principles Applied

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Reused existing UI components (Card, Button, Table, etc.)
   - Created centralized mock data file
   - Single source of truth for all metrics

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - Separation of data, business logic, and presentation
   - Small, focused functions (all under 150 lines)

3. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Strict typing throughout
   - No `any` types used

4. **Component Architecture**
   - Average component size: ~150 lines
   - Clear prop interfaces
   - Proper state management
   - Efficient re-renders

5. **Code Organization**
   - Logical file structure
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Clear imports/exports
   - Self-documenting code

### Reused Components

Successfully leveraged existing component library:

- ✅ `Card` - for all section containers
- ✅ `View` - for page layout
