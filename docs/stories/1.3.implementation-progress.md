- Test filters
- Test form validation
- Test TanStack Query hooks with MSW
- Test loading states
- Test error handling

### Task 15: Integration and Polish
**Status:** Partial (60%)
**What's Done:**
- ✅ Module exports created
- ✅ Router configuration created
- ❌ Add to main router
- ❌ Add to navigation menu
- ❌ Test authentication integration
- ❌ Test permission-based rendering
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Final UI polish

## 🔧 Integration Steps Required

To complete the implementation, the following integration steps are needed:

### 1. Add Routes to Main Router
**File to Modify:** Main router configuration file

```typescript
import { employeeRoutes } from '@src/app/employee';

// Add to route configuration:
{
  ...employeeRoutes
}
```

### 2. Add Navigation Menu Item
**File to Modify:** Main navigation component

```typescript
<NavLink to="/employees">
  <IconUsers /> Karyawan
</NavLink>
```

### 3. Verify API Integration
**Requirements:**
- Ensure Story 1.2 backend APIs are deployed and accessible
- Configure correct API base URL if needed
- Test all CRUD operations
- Verify authentication token handling

### 4. Test Permission Integration
**Requirements:**
- Verify `useAuth()` hook provides correct permissions
- Test permission-based UI rendering
- Test permission-based API access

## 📝 Notes and Observations

### Strengths
1. **Type Safety:** Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
2. **Code Reuse:** Leveraged existing components (SelectDivision, SelectJobPosition, RecordTable)
3. **Patterns:** Followed existing codebase patterns consistently
4. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with Indonesian messages
5. **State Management:** Proper TanStack Query usage with cache management
6. **Validation:** Strong client-side validation with Zod
7. **UX:** Loading states, empty states, error states all implemented

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Photo Upload:** Currently uses base64, should integrate with proper file upload service
2. **Testing:** No tests written yet (Task 14)
3. **Accessibility:** ARIA labels need to be added comprehensively
4. **Mobile:** Needs responsive testing and mobile table optimization
5. **Performance:** Bundle size optimization not yet done
6. **Documentation:** Component JSDoc comments could be more detailed

### Technical Debt
1. Permission checking is simplified - needs proper RBAC implementation
2. Photo upload needs proper file upload API integration
3. Manager selector not implemented (could reuse employee selector)
4. Pagination could be optimized with virtual scrolling for large datasets

## 🚀 Ready for Integration

The core employee management frontend is **ready for integration testing**. All major components are implemented and functional. Remaining work is primarily:
- Integration with main app
- Responsive design testing
- Accessibility testing
- Component testing
- Performance optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Integrate routes and navigation into main app
2. **Short-term:** Complete responsive and accessibility testing
3. **Medium-term:** Write component tests
4. **Long-term:** Performance optimization and polish
