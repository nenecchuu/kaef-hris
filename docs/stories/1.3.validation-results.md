### ✅ No Unfilled Placeholders
All content properly filled with specific details. No {{placeholders}} or _TBD_ markers found.

### ⚠️ Missing Template Sections (Non-Critical)
- **Change Log section** - Not present but can be added during implementation
- **Dev Agent Record section** - Will be populated during implementation
- **QA Results section** - Will be populated post-implementation

**Note:** These are agent/tracking sections, not blocking for implementation.

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix - Story Blocked)

### ✅ NONE IDENTIFIED

Story has no blocking issues preventing frontend implementation.

---

## Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

### 1. Routing Configuration Details
**Issue:** Routing setup mentioned but integration steps minimal
**Current:** "Add employee module to routing configuration" (Task 15.2)
**Enhancement:** Add specific routing file path and pattern examples
**Severity:** LOW (existing patterns clear from architecture)

### 2. Testing Framework Specification
**Issue:** Story mentions Vitest but existing project may use different framework
**Current:** "Vitest for unit testing" in Dev Notes
**Recommendation:** Verify actual testing framework in existing codebase
**Severity:** LOW (can be adjusted during implementation)

---

## Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Component Storybook Documentation
**Suggestion:** Consider adding Storybook stories for component showcase
**Benefit:** Better component documentation and visual testing

### 2. Performance Metrics
**Suggestion:** Add specific performance thresholds (Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals)
**Current:** "< 3s initial load"
**Enhancement:** Add specific targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)

### 3. Internationalization Preparation
**Suggestion:** Consider i18n structure even if only Indonesian now
**Benefit:** Future-proof for multiple language support
