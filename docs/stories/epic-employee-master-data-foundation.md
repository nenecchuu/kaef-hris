# Epic: Employee Master Data Foundation - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic ID:** EMP-001
**Created:** 2025-09-29
**Status:** Ready for Story Development
**Type:** Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Establish foundational Employee Master Data system by separating Employee business entities from User authentication, implementing core CRUD operations, and creating the essential data structure that PT Kimia Farma's HRIS system requires for comprehensive employee management.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current functionality: User authentication with basic organizational structure (Division, JobPosition)
- Technology stack: Laravel 9.19 + PostgreSQL + React 18.3 + TanStack Query + Radix UI
- Integration points: Existing User/Role system, audit trail, Division/JobPosition models

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added: Separate Employee model with comprehensive employee data independent from authentication
- How it integrates: Employee model links to User model (nullable), extends existing organizational structure
- Success criteria: Complete employee CRUD operations, proper User-Employee separation, HRIS-ready data foundation

## Stories

### Story 1: Create Employee Model and Database Schema

**Summary:** Design and implement comprehensive Employee model with relationships to existing Division/JobPosition models, including migration and seeding

**Key Components:**

- Employee model with full HRIS fields (personal, professional, employment details)
- Database migration with proper indexing and constraints
- Relationships to existing User, Division, JobPosition models
- Child tables for education, certifications, licenses
- Database seeding with sample PT Kimia Farma data

### Story 2: Implement Employee CRUD API Endpoints

**Summary:** Build REST API controllers, services, and repositories following existing Laravel patterns with proper validation and authorization

**Key Components:**

- EmployeeController with full CRUD operations
- Employee service layer for business logic
- Repository pattern implementation
- Laravel Form Requests for validation
- API Resources for response formatting
- Integration with existing RBAC system

### Story 3: Build Employee Management Frontend Interface

**Summary:** Create React components for employee directory, detail views, and CRUD operations using existing UI patterns and TanStack Query

**Key Components:**

- Employee list/directory view with search and filtering
- Employee detail view with tabbed interface
- Employee create/edit forms with validation
- Integration with TanStack Query for state management
- Responsive design using existing TailwindCSS patterns

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (new /api/employees endpoints only)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (new tables, no existing table modifications)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (Radix UI + TailwindCSS + established module structure)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (proper indexing, follows existing query patterns)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complexity of Employee-User relationship affecting existing authentication flows
- **Mitigation:** Employee model completely separate with nullable User relationship, existing auth untouched
- **Rollback Plan:** Drop new employee tables and remove new API routes, existing system unaffected

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (User management, auth flows remain intact)
- ✅ Integration points working correctly (Employee-Division, Employee-JobPosition relationships)
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately (API documentation, database schema docs)
- ✅ No regression in existing features (existing User/Role/Auth functionality unaffected)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- ✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- ✅ No architectural documentation is required (extends existing architecture)
- ✅ Enhancement follows existing patterns (Laravel API + React patterns)
- ✅ Integration complexity is manageable (leverages existing models and patterns)

**Risk Assessment:**

- ✅ Risk to existing system is low (separate Employee entity, nullable User relationship)
- ✅ Rollback plan is feasible (drop new tables, remove new routes)
- ✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality (verify User/Auth unchanged)
- ✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing Division/JobPosition models)

**Completeness Check:**

- ✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable (Employee Master Data foundation)
- ✅ Stories are properly scoped (Database → API → Frontend)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable (CRUD operations, proper separation, integration working)
- ✅ Dependencies are identified (existing User/Division/JobPosition models)

## Technical Context

**Current System Analysis:**

- **Project Type:** Brownfield enhancement of existing KAEF HRIS (originally "Luminakra Sample App")
- **Architecture:** Laravel 9.19 monolithic API + React 18.3 SPA
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Eloquent ORM
- **Authentication:** Laravel Passport + Sanctum with existing RBAC
- **Frontend State:** TanStack Query with Radix UI + TailwindCSS

**Integration Points:**

- User model: Nullable one-to-one relationship (employee can exist without system access)
- Division model: Required relationship for organizational assignment
- JobPosition model: Required relationship for role assignment
- Audit trail: Extend existing audit system for employee data changes
- RBAC: Use existing permission system for employee data access

**Existing Patterns to Follow:**

- Repository pattern for data access (`app/Repositories/`)
- Service layer for business logic (`app/Services/`)
- API Resources for response formatting (`app/Http/Resources/`)
- Laravel Form Requests for validation (`app/Http/Requests/`)
- React modules in `resources/app/` with TanStack Query hooks

## Story Manager Handoff

**Instructions for Story Development:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Laravel 9.19 + React 18.3 + PostgreSQL
- Integration points: User model (nullable relationship), Division model, JobPosition model, existing audit trail system
- Existing patterns to follow: Repository pattern, Service layer, API Resources, Laravel Form Requests, React/TanStack Query modules
- Critical compatibility requirements: No changes to existing User authentication, maintain RBAC patterns, follow existing API resource patterns
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering foundational Employee Master Data capabilities for PT Kimia Farma's HRIS system."

**Required Story Elements:**

1. **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable, testable requirements
2. **Technical Tasks:** Detailed implementation steps following existing patterns
3. **Integration Testing:** Verify existing User/Auth/RBAC functionality unaffected
4. **API Specifications:** REST endpoints following existing conventions
5. **UI Requirements:** Components using established Radix UI + TailwindCSS patterns

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**

- Existing User model and authentication system
- Current Division and JobPosition models
- Established RBAC permission system
- Existing audit trail implementation

**Technical Dependencies:**

- Laravel 9.19 with Eloquent ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- React 18.3 with TypeScript
- TanStack Query for state management
- Existing UI component library (Radix UI + TailwindCSS)

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics:**

- Employee CRUD operations functioning with <200ms response times
- Zero regression in existing User authentication flows
- Employee-User relationship properly separated and working
- Integration with Division/JobPosition models validated

**Business Metrics:**

- HRD managers can create, view, update employee records
- Employee data properly separated from authentication concerns
- Foundation ready for additional HRIS modules (career paths, performance, etc.)
- PT Kimia Farma organizational structure properly represented

## Next Steps

1. **Story Manager:** Develop detailed user stories with specific acceptance criteria
2. **Technical Lead:** Review architectural approach and validate integration points
3. **Implementation:** Begin with Story 1 (Database Schema) as foundation
4. **Testing:** Comprehensive integration testing to ensure no existing functionality regression
